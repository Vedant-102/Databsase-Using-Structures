# Databsase-Using-Structures
Display the info of Mobile Devices in a Store, sorted by their price. Each device's information is stored in a database using structures &amp; arrays. The program should read the data from the database, organize according to price &amp; then print the details of each device in order of price.  Provide a consistent method to sort the devices.

In this program, we will create a database for  a Mobile Store, storing the data of their products. We will use structures & arrays to store the data. The data will be sorted according to the price of the product & printed accordingly. For ease of programming we will take only 3 inputs here, but the code can be easily edited to store more values and it will run without any errors.
